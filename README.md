# ClusterPack
### What is in ClusterPack:
Clusterpack contains the function KNN_Euc for KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm with options for calculating distance (Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski) all distance functions are optimized in C++. The Package also contains the K_Means function to run the K-Means algorithm with options for calculating distance. 

### What is left to be done in ClusterPack:
Create Cosine Similarity, and Jacard distance functions. Create functions for visualizing data with ggplot.
