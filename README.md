# ClusterPack
### What is in ClusterPack:
ClusterPack contains functions for KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm, K-Means algorithm. Contains Euclidean distance function optimized in C++. Minkowski_distance function calculates the Minkowski distance between two vectors; Manhattan_distance function calculates the Manhattan distance between two vectors

### What is left to be done in ClusterPack:
Finish KNN algorithm, create Mean-Shift Clustering algorithm or the CLARANS algorithm depending on time. Integrate K-Means algorithm over to package. Create Minkowski, Manhattan, Cosine Similarity, and Jacard distance functions. Create functions for visualizing data with ggplot and a possible vignette.
